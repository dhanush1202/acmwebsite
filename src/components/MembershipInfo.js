              Volunteers are the supporting pillars of any student chapter. It
              is the same with ACM. In our student chapter, we have volunteers
              working under 5 teams: Technical team, Events and PR team, Social
              Media team, Design team and Coding team. Be it any event, our
              volunteers are our strength that make the event successful.
              Together, we celebrate our success; these teams work as pillars
              for ACM. By helping each other and appreciating others work, Team
              ACM moves forward. Vol List
